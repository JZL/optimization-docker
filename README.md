## I am getting an error running the image!
If you are getting an error running the image (e.g., "port is already allocation") you should kill the existing docker containers. You can do it by running `docker ps`.

You will see the docker containers as follows

```
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                 COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS                   PORTS                    NAMES
db8b31714ae7   optimization-docker   "tini -g -- start.shâ€¦"   3 minutes ago   Up 3 minutes (healthy)   0.0.0.0:8888->8888/tcp   pedantic_haslett
```

Take the name of the container you would like to close and run, in this case, `docker kill pedantic_haslett`.

## To build the image (not necessary for the class)
To build the image run 
```bash
docker build --rm --tag optimization-docker .
```
